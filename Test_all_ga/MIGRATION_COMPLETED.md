## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with New API
```cpp
// Create GA parameters
GAParameters params;
params.population_size = 100;
params.crossover_type = "simulated_binary";
params.mutation_type = "gaussian";
params.selection_type = "tournament";

// Create custom optimizer
class MyOptimizer : public GeneticAlgorithmOptimizer {
    double EvaluateFitness(const Individual& ind) override {
        return -myObjectiveFunction(ind.chromosome);
    }
};

// Run optimization
MyOptimizer optimizer(params);
Individual best = optimizer.Run();
```

### Direct Operator Usage
```cpp
// Create operators via factories
auto crossover_op = crossover::CreateCrossoverOperator("simulated_binary");
auto mutation_op = mutation::CreateMutationOperator("gaussian");
auto selection_op = selection::CreateSelectionOperator("tournament");

// Use operators directly
auto offspring = crossover_op->Crossover(parent1, parent2, rng);
auto mutated = mutation_op->Mutate(individual, rng);
int selected = selection_op->Select(population, rng);
```
